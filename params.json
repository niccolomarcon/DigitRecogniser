  "body": "### Installation\r\nThis project uses mainly two libraries: numpy and matplotlib. cPickle and gzip are also used to load the mnist database. The easiest way to get started is to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda), information can be found [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) for every OS.\r\n\r\nIf your goal is a simple presentation click this [link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/niccolomarcon/DigitRecogniser/blob/master/notebook.ipynb) to open the jupyter notebook in your browser so you do not have to install anything.\r\n\r\n### Run the script\r\nSimply run\r\n```\r\n$ python main.py\r\n```\r\nYou should see an output like this\r\n```\r\nLoading the dataset...\r\nDataset Loaded\r\n\r\nLearning...\r\nLearned\r\n\r\nAccuracy:\r\n  train -> 98.60%\r\n  test  -> 77.60%\r\n\r\nRandom test:\r\n  guess   9\r\n  correct 9\r\n```\r\nand a window with the image of a hand written nine should open.\r\n\r\n### Run the notebook\r\nIf you have installed Anaconda you should be able to run\r\n```\r\n$ jupyter notebook\r\n```\r\nso you can play with the notebook in the browser.",
